# 🛍️ Retail Sales Dashboard 
This is my first hands-on Retail Sales Dashboard built using Power BI to visualize customer behavior and sales trends in a retail environment.

It is designed to be interactive — data updates dynamically based on slicer selections for City, Product, and Membership Type. This allows users to filter views and dive deeper into sales patterns, product performance, and customer segmentation.
